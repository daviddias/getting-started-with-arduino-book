# Getting Started with Arduino Examples made with Johnny-Five

This are the examples found in "Getting Started with Arduino" Book by Massimo Banzi co-founder of Arduino, but using Rick Waldron Node.js Module, Johnny-Five

The goal of this project was to get into Node.js Hardware Hacking, I though the best was follow the examples an try to replicate same goal with Javascript. 

However, I get stuck on "Driving Bigger Loads" since I don't have some of the parts (for now =) )
