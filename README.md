# Getting Started with Arduino Examples made with Johnny-Five

This are the examples found in ["Getting Started with Arduino" Book, 2nd Edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596155520.do) by Massimo Banzi co-founder of Arduino, but using [Rick Waldron](https://twitter.com/rwaldron) Node.js Module, [Johnny-Five](https://github.com/rwldrn/johnny-five)

The goal of this project was to get into Node.js Hardware Hacking, I though the best was follow the examples an try to replicate same goal with Javascript. 

However, I get stuck on "Driving Bigger Loads" since I don't have some of the parts (for now =) )
